In both cases, _top_ refers to the furthest distance in the Z-axis, and _left_ refers to the furthest distance in the X-axis.


**These deform in the following manner:**

The distance between _TopLeft_ and _TopRight_ will be deformed relative to the distance between _Rail1_ and _Rail2_ at the far block boundary in the positive direction of construction.

The distance between _BottomLeft_ and _BottomRight_ will be deformed relative to the distance between _Rail_ and _Rail2_ at the near block boundary in the positive direction of construction.
