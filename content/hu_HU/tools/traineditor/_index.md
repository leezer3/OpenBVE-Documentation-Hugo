## ■ Overview

This tool can be used to more conveniently edit the train.dat. You can configure the train haracteristics, preview the acceleration curves and edit the motor sound curves.

Please refer to the documentation of the [train.dat]({{< ref "/trains/train_dat/_index.md" >}}) for explanations about the various entries.

## ■ Notes

The *BrakeNotches* setting in the *Handle* section includes the hold brake device - the train.dat works this way. This means that the number of actual brake notches (excluding the hold brake) will be one lower than entered in the *BrakeNotches* field if the hold brake device is used.
