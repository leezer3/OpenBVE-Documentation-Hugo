Whilst using the NewXParser or Assimp, openBVE supports most Direct.X object file features, other than animations.

The original parser supports a more limited subset of the DirectX .x object format, based upon that generated by the BVE4 Structure Viewer.

#### Color key transparencies in textures

For legacy reasons, the color of **pure black (0,0,0)** is reserved when used in a texture.
If a texture contains this color, then these pixels will be rendered as transparent.
