## <a name="overview"></a>■ 1. 總概

The panel.cfg file allows to create 2D panels by defining which elements to use, like speedometers, pressure gauges etc., and where they are to be placed.

The panel.cfg file is a plain text file encoded in any arbitrary [encoding]({{< ref "/information/encodings/_index.md" >}}), however, UTF-8 with a byte order mark is the preferred choice. The [parsing model]({{< ref "/information/numberformats/_index.md" >}}) for numbers is **Loose**, however, you are encouraged to produce *Strict* output nonetheless. The file is required to be located inside the train folder and is expected to be named **panel.cfg**. The file is interpreted on a per-line basis, from top to bottom.

#### The panel.cfg is outdated

The panel.cfg has been superseded by the panel2.cfg. You can achieve the full functionality of the panel.cfg and more by using the panel2.cfg instead. If both files are present in the train folder, the panel2.cfg has precedence over the panel.cfg.

#### 覆蓋和光暗

The cab is rendered as an overlay. This means that the cab will always appear in front of scenery objects. This is intentional, because this way, rain, walls and other obstructing objects cannot be accidentally rendered inside the cab. Furthermore, lighting in the cab is different than in the scenery. While the ambient brightness is reflected in the cab, the ambient color is not, and the cab always appears as if reflecting white light.

## <a name="syntax"></a>■ 2. 句法

Each line in the file can be empty (or solely consist of white spaces) and will be ignored, can mark the beginning of a new section or contain key-value pairs inside a section. All key-value pairs relate to the last section opened.

A new section is opened by starting the line with an opening bracket (U+005B) and ending it with a closing bracket (U+005D). The text in-between the brackets indicates the name of the section and is case-insensitive. White spaces at the beginning and the end of the line are ignored, as well as at the beginning and the end of the name of the section. Thus, the beginning of the section has the following form:

{{% command %}}  
[NameOfTheSection]  
{{% /command %}}

A key-value pair is indicated by giving the key, an equals sign (U+003D) and then the value. The key is case-insensitive. White spaces at the beginning and the end of the line are ignored, as well as in front and after the equals sign. Alternatively, white spaces surrounding the key and the value are ignored. Thus, a key-value pair as the following form:

{{% command %}}  
NameOfTheKey = Value  
{{% /command %}}

Some values are further split into multiple parts, separated by commas (U+002C). Instead of a comma, a colon (U+003A) can be used interchangeably.

您可以在一行的末尾添加注释。注释由分号(U+003B,英文半角)开始。所有注释在开始解析文件之前就将被自动排除。 

## <a name="panel"></a>■ 3. The Panel section

The Panel section defines which background image to use. Only one Panel section is expected in a panel.cfg file.

------

{{% command %}}  
[Panel]  
{{% /command %}}

This starts the section.

------

{{% command %}}  
Background = *FileName*  
{{% /command %}}

{{% command-arguments %}}  
***FileName***: The image file to use as the panel background image.  
{{% /command-arguments %}}

Defines which background image to use. *File* is relative to the train folder. The image is aligned at the bottom-left of the screen, where a width of 480 corresponds to the right edge of the screen. You cannot meaningfully use images of larger width with the panel.cfg. Consider using the panel2.cfg if you want to employ images of any size. If this key-value pair is not used, the background image file is implicitly assumed to be called *Panel.bmp*. Pure blue in the image (red=0, green=0, blue=255) represents transparent pixels.

## <a name="view"></a>■ 4. The View section

The View section defines the viewing angle conditions. Only one View section is expected in a panel.cfg file.

------

{{% command %}}  
[View]  
{{% /command %}}

This starts the section.

------

{{% command %}}  
Yaw = *ValueInDegrees*  
{{% /command %}}

{{% command-arguments %}}  
***ValueInDegrees***: A floating-point number measured in **degrees** indicating the yaw. Positive values represent right, negative ones left. The default value is 0.  
{{% /command-arguments %}}

{{% command %}}  
Pitch = *ValueInDegrees*  
{{% /command %}}

{{% command-arguments %}}  
***ValueInDegrees***: A floating-point number measured in **degrees** indicating the pitch. Positive values represent up, negative ones down. The default value is 0.  
{{% /command-arguments %}}

Defines the pitch of the view. Any value entered will be additionally subtract by 11 degrees, resulting in a slight downward pitch if *ValueInDegrees* is 0. If this key-value pair is not used, the final viewing angle will be -11 degrees.

## <a name="pressureindicator"></a>■ 5. The PressureIndicator section

This section creates a pressure indicator. You can use as many of these sections as required.

------

{{% command %}}  
[PressureIndicator]  
{{% /command %}}

This starts the section.

**1**: The pressure indicator is an LED.  
{{% /command-arguments %}}

![illustration_pressuregauge](/images/illustration_pressuregauge.png)![illustration_pressuregauge_led](/images/illustration_pressuregauge_led.png)

This defines the type of the pressure indicator. While both the gauge type and the LED type indicators can show two different pressures, this is not generally useful for the LED type as the upper LED shape will block the view into the lower LED shape.

Creates ATC indicators. The bitmap is required to have 13 square elements stacked horizontally, anchored at the right of the bitmap. The height of the bitmap defines the size of one square element. From left to right, the elements represent:

![illustration_atc](/images/illustration_atc.png)

- *1<sup>st</sup>*: ATC not currently available
- *2<sup>nd</sup>*: 0 km/h speed restriction
- *3<sup>rd</sup>*: 15 km/h speed restriction

- *5<sup>th</sup>*: 45 km/h speed restriction
- *6<sup>th</sup>*: 55 km/h speed restriction

- *11<sup>th</sup>*: 110 km/h speed restriction
- *12<sup>th</sup>*: 120 km/h speed restriction
- *13<sup>th</sup>*: ATS currently active

The center of any of the indicators is placed on a circle defined by *Center* as the center of the circle and *AtsRadius* as the radius of the circle. The angle at which an element is placed on that circle corresponds to the respective speed, or to the 6 o'clock position for the *ATC not currently available* and *ATS currently active* indicators. Only the one currently representative indicator is shown. Pure blue in the image (red=0, green=0, blue=255) represents transparent pixels.

Creates an indicator depicting the state of the power and brake handles. The bitmap is required to have a certain number of elements (depending on the train characteristics) stacked horizontally, anchored at the left of the bitmap. The height of the bitmap is equivalent to the height of an element. Pure blue in the image (red=0, green=0, blue=255) represents transparent pixels. The meaning of the elements depends on the type of brake systems used:

*For air brakes, from left to right:*

- Power notch *n*
- Power notch *n*-1
- ...
- Power notch *2*
- Power notch *1*
- Release (REL)
