## <a name="overview"></a>■ 1. 개요

애니메이션 개체 형식은 다른 개체(B3D/CSV/X)를 참조하고 애니메이션을 적용할 수 있는 컨테이너 형식입니다. 또한 다른 개체(다른 애니메이션 개체 포함)를 애니메이션화하지 않고 그룹화할 수 있습니다.

.animated 오브젝트는 .CSV/RW 루트(일부 구문 제외)에 이용될 수 있고,  *extensions.cfg* 파일을 통해 차량의 외부시점 오브젝트 또는 *panel.animated* 파일을 통해 3D 캡뷰로도 이용될 수 있다.

##### ● 기본

Animation is performed via the following primitives:

- 상태 변경 - 기본적으로 다른 개체 간에 언제든지 전환할 수 있음
- 이동 - 물체를 세 개의 독립된 방향으로 이동
- 회전 - 세 개의 독립된 축을 중심으로 물체가 회전합니다.
- 텍스처 이동 - 물체의 텍스처 좌표를 두 개의 독립된 방향으로 이동할 수 있습니다

{{% warning-nontitle %}}

If an animated object is used within a group, any distance based functions such as **CameraDistance** refer to the relative transformed center of the child object, not that of the parent object.

{{% /warning-nontitle %}}

##### ● 약간의 형식

파일은 임의로 인코딩된 일반 텍스트 파일이다. [인코딩]({{< ref "/information/encodings/_index.md" >}}), 하지만, UTF-8바이트 순서 표시를 선호한다. [파싱모델]({{< ref "/information/numberformats/_index.md" >}}) 숫자**Strict** 있다. 파일 이름, 하지만 연장 **.animated**이 있어야 한다는 자의적이야. 파일per-line 기초 위에 위에서 아래로 해석됩니다.

## <a name="description"></a>■ 2. 구역

##### ● [Include] 영역

다른 물체를 포함하고 있으나 이들의 움직임을 계산하지 않고[포함]섹션을 사용할 수 있다. 이 용기가 다른 개체 그룹화하는 것은 ANIMATED 개체 파일을 사용할 수 있습니다. 파일 내에[포함]의 섹션이 있을 수 있는 번호입니다.

{{% command %}}  
[Include]  
{{% /command %}}  
이것은 구문을 시작합니다

{{% command %}}  
*파일이름<sub>0</sub>*  
*파일이름<sub>1</sub>*  
*파일이름<sub>2</sub>*  
...  
{{% /command %}}  
현재 상태로 포함되어야 하는 일련의 B3D/CSV/X/ANIMITED 객체를 정의합니다.

{{% command %}}
**위치 = X, Y, Z**
{{% /command %}}
이것은 개체의 위치를 정의하며, 기본적으로 나머지 애니메이션 개체 파일에 대해 개체를 상쇄할 수 있다.

------

##### ● [Object] 영역

[Object] 섹션을 사용하여 단일 애니메이션을 만들 수 있다. 이를 위해서는 *States* 파라미터를 통해 적어도 하나의 상태를 설정하고 원하는 기능의 조합을 사용하여 애니메이션을 제어해야 한다. 파일 내에 [Object] 섹션이 얼마든지 있을 수 있다.

{{% command %}}  
[Object]  
{{% /command %}}  
이것은 구문을 시작합니다

{{% command %}}  
**Position = X, Y, Z**  
{{% /command %}}  
개체의 위치를 정의합니다. 기본적으로 이것은 각각의 독특한 CSV/B3D 파일에서 최종 TranslateAll 명령 통해 수행되는 기능의 수행된다 해당합니다. 만약 당신이 회전을 사용하고 싶어 예를 들어, 의식은 그 회전은 기원(0,0,0)에 끝나지 않고 있다. 그 *Position* 명령 후 회전을 수행하기가 당신이 개체를 확보할 수 있습니다.

{{% command %}}  
**States = File<sub>0</sub>, File<sub>1</sub>, ..., File<sub>n-1</sub>**  
{{% /command %}}  
CSV/B3D/X 확장의 *n* 개체를 로드합니다. 표시된 첫 번째 파일에 상태 인덱스가 0입니다. 상태 변경을 사용할 경우에만 여러 파일을 사용하십시오.

{{% command %}}  
**StateFunction = Formula**  
{{% /command %}}  
이것은 상태 변화에 대한 기능을 정의합니다. *Formula*의 결과는 가장 가까운 정수로 반올림됩니다. 해당 정수가 0과 *n*-1 사이인 경우, 여기서 *n*은 *States*를 통해 정의된 상태 수입니다. 그렇지 않으면 해당 상태가 표시되고, 그렇지 않으면 개체가 표시되지 않습니다. 객체가 하나의 상태에서만 켜거나 끄도록 하려면 후자를 사용할수 있습니다.

{{% command %}}  
**TranslateXDirection = X, Y, Z**  
**TranslateYDirection = X, Y, Z**  
**TranslateZDirection = X, Y, Z**  
{{% /command %}}  
These define the directions for the *TranslateXFunction*, *TranslateYFunction* and *TranslateZFunction*, respectively. The default directions are:

*TranslateXDirection = 1, 0, 0*  
*TranslateYDirection = 0, 1, 0*  
*TranslateZDirection = 0, 0, 1*

This means that TranslateXFunction will move right by default, TranslateYFunction up and TranslateZFunction forward, which is also why TranslateXFunction and so on bear their names. If you define other directions, then simply think of the three functions and associated directions as three independent ways to move the object in that direction.

{{% command %}}  
**TranslateXFunction = Formula**  
**TranslateYFunction = Formula**  
**TranslateZFunction = Formula**  
{{% /command %}}  
These define the functions to move the object into the respective direction. The *Formula* needs to return the amount of meters to move from the initial position. The *X*, *Y* and *Z* parameters in the respective direction are multiplied by the result of *Formula*, so you could for example either multiple the formula by 2 or the direction by 2 if you want to double the speed of movement.

{{% command %}}  
**RotateXDirection = X, Y, Z**  
**RotateYDirection = X, Y, Z**  
**RotateZDirection = X, Y, Z**  
{{% /command %}}  
These define the directions for the *RotateXFunction*, *RotateYFunction* and *RotateZFunction*, respectively. The default directions are:

*RotateXDirection = 1, 0, 0*  
*RotateYDirection = 0, 1, 0*  
*RotateZDirection = 0, 0, 1*

This means that RotateXFunction will rotate around the x-axis by default, RotateYFunction around the Y-axis, and RotateZFunction around the z-axis, which is also why RotateXFunction and so on bear their names. If you define other directions, then simply think of the three functions and associated directions as three independent ways to rotate the object.

{{% command %}}  
**RotateXFunction = Formula**  
**RotateYFunction = Formula**  
**RotateZFunction = Formula**  
{{% /command%}}  
These define the functions to rotate along the respective direction in counter-clockwise order. The *Formula* needs to return the angle by which to rotate in radians. The order in which the rotations are performed is: RotateXFunction (first), RotateYFunction (then) and RotateZFunction (last). If you use more than one rotation function at a time, bear this order in mind. If necessary, overwrite the default directions for the rotations if you need a different order.

{{% command %}}  
**RotateXDamping = NaturalFrequency, DampingRatio**  
**RotateYDamping = NaturalFrequency, DampingRatio**  
**RotateZDamping = NaturalFrequency, DampingRatio**  
{{% /command %}}  
These define damping for the corresponding functions. If not used, damping will not be performed. *NaturalFrequency* is a non-negative value corresponding to the angular frequency of an assumed undamped oscillator in radians per second. *DampingRatio* is a non-negative value indicating the type of damping. Values between 0 and 1 represent under-damping, 1 represents critical damping, and values above 1 represent over-damping.

{{% command %}}  
**TextureShiftXDirection = X, Y**  
**TextureShiftYDirection = X, Y**  
{{% /command %}}  
These define the directions for the *TextureShiftXFunction* and *TextureShiftYFunction*, respectively. The default directions are:

*TextureShiftXDirection = 1, 0*  
*TextureShiftYDirection = 0, 1*

This means that TextureShiftXFunction will shift the texture right by default, and TextureShiftYFunction down, which is also why TextureShiftXFunction and so on bear their names. If you define other directions, then simply think of the two functions and associated directions as two independent ways to shift textures on the objects.

{{% command %}}  
**TextureShiftXFunction = Formula**  
**TextureShiftYFunction = Formula**  
{{% /command %}}  
These define the functions to shift the texture in the respective direction. The texture is shifted by the return value of *Formula* in texture coordinates. The integer part of the result is ignored, and a fractional part of 0.5 represents moving the texture half way. The SetTextureCoordinate commands in the object file define the coordinates, which are then added the outcome of these formulas.

{{% command %}}  
**TrackFollowerFunction = Formula**  
{{% /command %}}  
This defines the function which moves an object along the path of **Rail 0**. *Formula* must return a distance in meters, for which the object is then moved, respecting the curves and height changes of **Rail 0**.

{{% command %}}  
**TextureOverride = Value**  
{{% /command %}}  
*Value* = **Timetable**: All faces will show the timetable bitmap as set up by CSV/RW routes.  
*Value* = **None**: The original textures will be displayed on the faces (default behavior).

{{% command %}}  
**RefreshRate = Seconds**  
{{% /command %}}  
This defines the minimum amount of time that needs to pass before the functions are updated. A value of 0 forces the functions to be updated every frame. Please note that objects outside of the visual range might be updated less frequently regardless of this parameter. Use RefreshRate when you don't need a perfectly smooth animation (in order to optimize performance), or when you deliberately want the object to be only updated in fixed intervals.

{{% warning %}}

openBVE 2 compatibility note

#### During the development of openBVE (v0.9) and during the development of the animated object format, there were certain commands in existance ending in *RPN*, such as *TranslateXFunctionRPN*. These commands never made it into any official release (v1.0) and were thus never meant to be used outside of development environments. While they are still available undocumentedly, they will be removed for openBVE 2. If you are using these commands, please get rid of them as soon as possible.

● About the formulas

##### First of all, infix notation, which is what you can enter for *Formula*, is converted into functional notation. Thus for every infix notation, there is a corresponding functional notation. Some functions do not have an infix operator and can thus only be entered in functional notation. For operators, precedence plays an important role. You can use parantheses to override the order of precedence just as in any usual mathematical formula. Names of functions are case-insensitive.

{{% warning-nontitle %}}

Please note that if the result of any mathematical operation or function would be infinity, indeterminate or non-real, 0 is returned. Numeric overflow is not prevented, so you need to take that into account yourself.

<br>

{{% warning-nontitle %}}  

The logical not and multiplication operator are not at the same precedence level as a lot of other languages. For example `!a + !b` is `!(!a + !(b))` **not** `(!a) + (!b)` as expected, similarly `1 * 2 / 3` is `1 * (2 / 3)` **not** `(1 * 2) / 3`  
Please also note that some combinations of prefix and infix operators are not recognised. For example `a*-b` is not accepted. Use `a*(-b)` or `-a*b` instead.

For consistency, Power[0,*b*] always returns 1, even in the degenerate case Power[0,0], and *a* being negative always returns 0. Adding more arguments will create a chain. Power[a,b,c] will return *a*<sup>*b*<sup>*c*</sup></sup>. | {{% /table-2col %}} |

| ● Trains | Generally, objects attached to a particular train and car return values for that train and car, unless stated otherwise. For scenery objects, the reference is the driver's car of the nearest train (not necessarily the player's train). |

In some of the following variables, *carIndex* has the following meaning: 0 is the 1<sup>st</sup> car from the front, 1 is the 2<sup>nd</sup> car from the front, etc., while -1 is the 1<sup>st</sup> car from the rear, -2 is the 2<sup>nd</sup> car from the rear, etc. In general, car indices from -*cars* to *cars*-1 represent existing cars, where *cars* is the number of cars the train has, while values outside of this range represent non-existing cars. As all trains have at least 1 car, indices -1 and 0 are guaranteed to exist for any train.

| <a name="performance"></a>■ 6. Performance  | There are certain kinds of animation which are less expensive, and others which are more. Also, the underlying object plays a significant role. If you want to design your animated objects with as best performance as possible **for future releases of openBVE**, take a look at the following performance table:                                                  |

| Bad       | Texture shifts           | Has only opaque faces        |
| Bad       | Texture shifts | Has partially transparent faces         |
| Bad | {{% /table %}}           | Performance is generally better if the result of a function only infrequently changes. So, even if you set the *RefreshRate* parameter to zero, performance is generally better if the outcome of your formula is constant over longer periods of time. On the other hand, if it changes every frame, performance is generally worse.         |
| Generally, you should avoid using animation with partially transparent faces and stick to opaque faces when possible. Also, try to avoid texture shifts, and consider using state changes or translation where possible. | <a name="tips"></a>■ 7. Tips | Generally speaking, try to keep the complexity of functions as low as possible. This is not the most critical aspect, though, as most of the performance impact will result from applying the results of a function, e.g. rotating the object, and not evaluating the function.         |

Use the RefreshRate parameter when possible to optimize performance. Usually, you can use this parameter when you don't need a smooth animation, or when you deliberately want the functions to only update in intervals.

Don't use functions which always evaluate to the same constant. For example, don't use RotateXFunction = 3.14159, but rotate the underlying CSV/B3D/X object directly.

State changes are very cheap as long as the state doesn't actually change in between two executions of the StateFunction. If a change occurs, this is a relatively expensive operation, though.

## Try to optimize out *if* conditions. Especially try to avoid nested *if* functions. Often, there is an elegant mathematical solution.

- Certain functions, e.g. Exp, Sin, Cos, etc., are relatively expensive. Use them only if absolutely necessary for an effect. Don't include unnecessary operations. For example, the result of StateFunction is automatically rounded toward the nearest integer, so don't apply an additional explicit Round.
- When working with car objects, bear in mind that some variables have an optional car index. You should use this index if you want to query the state of a particular car (that is, not necessarily the one the object is attached to). If, however, you just want to query the value of the particular car the object is attached to, use the variable without the index. For scenery objects, you should not generally use car indices as you can't be sure how many cars the queried train has.

● Employing an approach-controlled delay in signals

##### If you want to create a signal that keeps being red until the train approaches it to some distance, then counts down a timer before it changes aspect to green, please refer to [this post](http://web.archive.org/web/20100902041536/http://openbve.freeforums.org/delay-in-approach-controlled-signals-t1195.html#p5378) on the forum for a detailed explanation. Once you understand the concepts, you can use this code template:

{{% code "*Template for an approach-controlled delay in a signal with two aspects:*" %}}  
States = RED_OBJECT, GREEN_OBJECT  
StateFunction = if[trackDistance>DISTANCE | section==0, 0, min[value + 0.5*delta/DELAY, 1]]  
{{% /code %}}

##### {{% code "*Template for an approach-controlled delay in a signal with any number of aspects:*" %}}  
States = RED_OBJECT, ..., GREEN_OBJECT  
StateFunction = if[trackDistance>DISTANCE | section==0, 0, if[value<0.5, value + 0.5*value/DELAY, section]]  
{{% /code %}}

Using an approach controlled delay with a semaphore signal requires a slight variant on this technique. 
As the result of the StateFunction is rounded, whereas that of the RotateFunction is not, a combination of both is required to achieve the desired effect.

##### {{% code "*Template for an approach-controlled delay in a semaphore signal:*" %}}  
States = SIGNAL_ARM, SIGNAL_ARM  
StateFunction = if[trackDistance>DISTANCE | section==0, 0, min[value + 0.5*delta/DELAY, 1]]
RotateYFunction = if[currentState == 0, 0, -0.7]
