## <a name="overview"></a>■ 1. Présentation

The **train.xml** format is the native format for newer versions of OpenBVE, and is intended to replace the older train.dat format. It allows setting of many more properties, and is extensible.

It may either be constructed as a single file containing the properties of the entire train, or as a single consist definition, along with child car files.

{{% information %}}

#### Positions Within Cars:

In the **train.xml** format, all positions are measured relative to the center of the car, which is assumed to be at 0,0,0
Whilst this is a change for some parameters from the legacy BVE formats, it means that all positions should be consistant.

{{% /information %}}

## <a name="train"></a>■ 2. The Train section

Whether using child car files, or a single file, the first node in each **train.xml** file must be the **\<Train\>** node.

This supports the following properties:

{{% command %}}  
**\<Car>** *CarProperties* **\</Car>**  
{{% /command %}}

This defines a car within the train.

**CarProperties** may either be a set of child nodes (if using the single file format) or a relative on-disk path to a child car file.

{{% command %}}  
**\<DriverCar>** *Car* **\</DriverCar>**  
{{% /command %}}

**Car** must be a positive integer less than or equal to the number of cars in the train, setting the driver car.

{{% command %}}  
**\<NotchDescriptions>** *Notch* **\</NotchDescriptions>**  
{{% /command %}}

This overrides the in-game UI notch descriptions displayed.

**Notch** may be one or more child-nodes, with one of the following subjects: *Power, Brake, LocoBrake* or *Reverser*

A child-node must be of the following format:

{{% command %}}  
**\<Subject>** *Descriptions* **\</Subject>**  
{{% /command %}}

**Descriptions** should be a comma or semi-colon separated list, equal to the number of notches the train has for the subject.

The entries for this list must be placed in order from low to high. 

For an example brake or locomotive brake handle with EB, hold brake and 8 notches, the following would be used:

{{% function "_Example Brake Handle NotchDescriptions:_" %}}  
\<NotchDescriptions>EB,HLD,N,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\</NotchDescriptions>  
{{% /function %}}

A train using the automatic air-brake has a total of three notches, e.g:

{{% function "_Example Brake Handle NotchDescriptions:_" %}}  
\<NotchDescriptions>EB,REL,LAP,SRV\</NotchDescriptions>  
{{% /function %}}

For an example power handle with 8 notches, the following would be used:

{{% function "_Example Power Handle NotchDescriptions:_" %}}  
\<NotchDescriptions>N,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\</NotchDescriptions>  
{{% /function %}}

The reverser must be in the order Neutral, Forwards, Reverse:

{{% function "_Example Reverser Handle NotchDescriptions:_" %}}  
\<NotchDescriptions>N,F,R\</NotchDescriptions>  
{{% /function %}}

{{% /command-arguments %}}

## <a name="power"></a>■ 3.1. The Power section

Motor cars may specifiy a **\<Power>** node.

This defines the acceleration curves and the power handle fitted to the car, and supports the following child nodes:

### 3.1.1. Acceleration Curves

{{% warning-nontitle %}}

In the **train.dat** acceleration curve figures are given for the train as a whole, and an internal calculation is performed to produce the per-car acceleration figures.
<br><br>
However, in **train.xml** acceleration curve figures apply to the current car only.

------

The **\<AccelerationCurves>** child node should contain a list of acceleration curve nodes. These must be in ascending order, and should correspond to the number of power notches the train has.

Currently, the only supported acceleration curve node is the **\<OpenBVE>** node, supporting the following properties (as per a **train.dat** acceleration curve):

{{% command %}}  
**\<StageZeroAcceleration>** *Acceleration* **\</StageZeroAcceleration>**  
{{% /command %}}

**Acceleration** should be a positive floating-point number representing the acceleration at a speed of 0 km/h expressed in km/h/s.

{{% command %}}  
**\<StageOneAcceleration>** *Acceleration* **\</StageOneAcceleration>**  
{{% /command %}}

**Acceleration** should be a positive floating-point number representing the acceleration at a speed of *n* km/h expressed in km/h/s.

{{% command %}}  
**\<StageOneSpeed>** *Speed* **\</StageOneSpeed>**  
{{% /command %}}

**Speed** should be a positive floating-point number representing the reference speed for *StageOneAcceleration*

{{% command %}}  
**\<StageTwoExponent>** *Exponent* **\</StageTwoExponent>**  
{{% /command %}}

**Exponent** should be a positive floating-point number representing the exponent used in the stage two speed calculation.

{{% command %}}  
**\<StageTwoSpeed>** *Speed* **\</StageTwoSpeed>**  
{{% /command %}}

**Speed** should be a positive floating-point number representing the reference speed for *StageTwoExponent*


Thus:

If the speed of the train is 0 km/h, *a<sub>0</sub>* indicates the acceleration output.

If the speed of the train is between 0 km/h and *v<sub>1</sub>*, the acceleration output is determined via the following formula:

{{% function "*Acceleration between 0 km/h and v<sub>1</sub>, where x is the current speed of the train in km/h:*" %}}  
a<sub>0</sub> + (a<sub>1</sub> - a<sub>0</sub>) \* x / v<sub>1</sub>  
{{% /function %}}

If the speed of the train is *v<sub>1</sub>*, the acceleration output is indicated by *a<sub>1</sub>*.

If the speed of the train is between *v<sub>1</sub>* and *v<sub>2</sub>*, the acceleration output is determined via the following formula:

{{% function "*Acceleration between v<sub>1</sub> and v<sub>2</sub>, where x is the current speed of the train in km/h:*" %}}  
v<sub>1</sub> \* a<sub>1</sub> / x  
{{% /function %}}

If the speed of the train is greater than *v<sub>2</sub>*, the acceleration output is determined via the following formula (for version 2.0 exponents):

{{% function "_Acceleration above v<sub>2</sub>, where x is the current speed of the train in km/h:_" %}}  
v<sub>1</sub> \* a<sub>1</sub> \* v<sub>2</sub><sup>e-1</sup> / x<sup>e</sup>  
{{% /function %}}
